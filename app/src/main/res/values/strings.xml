    <string name="description_application_text" formatted="false">Welcome to the GalleryKeeper app, designed to automatically organize sensitive photos in your gallery. Using intelligent classification, it identifies sensitive images and instantly sorts them into dedicated folders directly within your gallery. With your privacy as its top priority, the app never saves any photos or personal data, either to its own storage or online. All processing is done offline: your content always remains on your device, under your exclusive control.\n\n
        This solution can also be combined with photo folder locking apps or utilities, providing an additional layer of protection for your sensitive content.</string>
